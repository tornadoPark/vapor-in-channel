# vapor-growth-in-channel
a vetical channel in silicon

heated from the bottom

heat conduction in silicon 

vapor generated and expansion pushing liquid water above 
      and than contaction
      
a horizotal venting at the vapor bottom

film formed between vapor and channel wall, described by Aussillous and Quere formula

heat conduction across the film 

film thinning and dry-out



Euler explict scheme for the vapor expansion
Implict scheme for transient heat conduction
